## Description:

Here in this project I have build a Cocktail menu application which can be used in Restaurants or Bars. This app also shows the recipies and all the description related to that perticular Cocktail.

## Tools and Technology used:

I have used React as the frontend, for routing of the pages I have used React-router and for the data of different cocktails, I have implemented it from an API "CocktailDB"(https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=). I have also published this application on Netlify.com.
